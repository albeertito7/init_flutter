Init Flutter Concepts

- mobile UI framework for creating natvies apps for IOS and Android
- single code base - DART
- only write the app once for multiple devices

- good layout methodology borrowed from responsive web
- very smooth and quick experience runnning apps
- works well with firebase as a backend
- uses DART, which is really easy language to pick up
- uses material design out-of-the-box
- great docs and guides on the Flutter website

- using android studio:
	- install flutter plugin
	- install dart plugin


WIDGETS

- everything inside the interface/app will be a widget, composing the content as components
- there're a lot of widgets pre-build to use easily
- some kind: text widget, button widget, row widget, column widget, image widget
- the widgets are fully customisable, using its properties: style, color, textAlign, overflow, ... etc
- each widget has its own programmable class
- we implement this widgets using DART: a programming language
- the idea is make a widget tree for each interface/screen


DART

- programming language developed by google
- compiled to javascript, and then executed
- staticly type program language -> you won't be able to change the type of an initialized variable


** I'M USING SUBLIME TEXT WITH THE DART PACKAGE INSTALLED TO MAKE THE FIRST PROGRAM TESTS **
** YOU CAN ALSO USE OTHERS LIKE VISUAL STUDIO CODE, WHICH HAS A DART PLUGIN TOO **
** A PART FROM THAT, TO EXECUTE THESE FILES I'VE INSTALLED INTO MY MACHINE USING 'BREW' THE DART SDK **


HOT RELOAD

- whenever we make a change in the code, the app can auto reload in the previous screen
- we need to use stateless widgets for this purpose
